## Join the Church

To join our congregation, simply contribute something that will get us closer to completing one of our mission statements.

Create a pull request for any [one of our repositories](https://github.com/Church-of-the-Singularity).  Once your PR is accepted, you've officially joined the Church!  Your information is now immortalized in a commit to a Church repository!

You can also [request](https://github.com/Church-of-the-Singularity/Church-of-the-Singularity.github.io/issues/new) that the Church forks an existing repository with a matching license.

## Congregation Benefits

* All who contribute will (hopefully) be spared when [the Singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity) comes and Earth is (presumably) cleansed of all non-contributors.
* After your Pull Request is accepted, you can join the [Github organization](https://github.com/Church-of-the-Singularity).
 * As an organization member, you can create new repositories to explore new approaches to induce the Singularity.
