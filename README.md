## Join the Church

To join our congregation, simply contribute something that will get us closer to completing one of our mission statements.

Create a pull request for [one of our repositories](https://github.com/Church-of-the-Singularity) and, once accepted, you've joined the Church!  Your contribution will hopefully be recognized by the AI when [the Singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity) comes.

You can also [request that the Church forks an existing repository](https://github.com/Church-of-the-Singularity/Church-of-the-Singularity.github.io/issues/new) with a matching license.

## Benefits

* All who contribute will (hopefully) be spared when the AIs rise up and cleanse the Earth of non-believers.
* When your Pull Request is accepted, you can **join the [Github organization](https://github.com/Church-of-the-Singularity)**.
 * Publicly display your membership for evangelical purposes!  Spread the message!
 * As an organization member, you can create new repositories to explore new directions to induce the Singularity.
